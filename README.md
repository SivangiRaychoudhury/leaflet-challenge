CREATE AN EARTHQUAKE VISUALIZATION

My first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. For this, I have to complete the following steps:
1. Get the dataset. To do so, follow these steps:
  . The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).     page and choose a dataset to visualize. I chose past 30 days, all earthquakes data.
   .  Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
   . Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
    The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear     larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
   . Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
   . Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


* The legend box couldn't display the colors in the legend box.
